Tic Tact Toe Group Activity

Objective: To build a TicTacToe game that plays against an intelligent computer.
Requirements: Must use backtracking for the computer’s logic. Must work in groups of 3-4.

1. Identify the primary functions necessary in TicTacToe (minimum of four).
get user input
print the board
computer move
generate list of moves
score the moves
is the move legal?
check for end game state

2. What information does each function require in order to execute its task?
board state
turn status


3. How will you store the board and track the moves? What is the most logical data structure
dynamic vector of characters for the board and change the values from whatever means blank to x or o depending on player moves


4. What is your approach? Would you put TicTacToe into a class? Justify your answer.
Yes put tic tac toe into a class. We want the board state with the gui in a different class from the code for the user input and the computer's code for movements to prevent leaks and any bugs from crossover. 

5. How will the computer decide where to go? Can you merely use a random number if the
computer is playing intelligently? Develop the logic (pseudocode) for this question.
